# iOS Calculator Clone in Flutter

## Project Overview
This project is my first attempt at creating an app and learning Flutter. The goal is to replicate the design, functionality, and oevrall user experience of the iOS Calculator. The app is built for iPhone and tested using Xcode's iPhone simulator.

By working on this project, I aim to:
* Learn the fundamentals of Flutter and Dart.
* Understand how to build responsive user interfaces.
* Gain experience with app functionality.
* Explore iPhone-specific UI design and development challenges.

## Features
**Identical Design**: Striving to match the iOS Calculator's layout, colors, and button styles.
**Core Calculator Functions**: Includes basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced features (e.g. perecntage, clear, memory).
**Responsive UI**: Designed to fit and work seamlessly on an iPhone screen.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites
* **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter]([doc:linking-to-pages#anchor-links](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))
* **Xcode**: Required for running the iPhone simulator ([download here](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12))

### How to Run
1. Close this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the app:
```console
$ flutter run lib/main.dart
```
4. Select the iPhone simulator in Xcode to preview the app.
```console
$ open -a Simulator
```

## Progress
### Completed:
* Basic app setup with Flutter and Xcode.
* Initial design of the calculator layout.

### To-Do:
* Add button functionality for calculator operations.
* Fine-tune the design to match the iOS Calculator exactly.
* Handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero, long calculations).
* Test on different iPhone resolutions.
